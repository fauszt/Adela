given :two sides and the intermediate angle
   Step 4: Take a b at the side of the b side and then with the aperture
   We pull the circle from the point. Then we extend the straight line according to angle Î±.
   Where the arcs intersect this line, the point C will be. The section between points A and C will be the side b.
